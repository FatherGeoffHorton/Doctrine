##### The Blessed Virgin Mary is truly and properly the Mother of God. *de fide*

Council of Ephesus, first anathema against Nestorius; see also Constantinople II, Capitula 6.

By using the term "Mother of God," the Church affirms two things:
1. Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man;
2. Mary is truly His mother.

Constantinople II anathematized anyone who would call the Blessed Virgin Mary "the mother of a man (ἀνθρωποτόκον) or the Mother of Christ (Χριστοτόκον), as if Christ were not God." #FIXME AWAY FROM SCHAPF! This was in response to an error still frequently made today, the claim that Mary is only the mother of the human nature of Christ. The relationship of mother to child is a relationship of person to person, not a relationship of person to nature (nor nature to nature), so to claim that Mary is the mother of Christ's humanity only is implicitly a claim of two persons in Christ, which is unacceptable (see #FIXME; see Cardinal Gibbon's *The Faith of Our Fathers*, 110th Ed., P. J. Kenedy and Sons, New York, 1917, p. 137.)

* Mary is endowed with a fullness of grace. de fide

##### By an extraordinary privilege the soul of our Lady was from the first instant of her existence preserved from all stain of original sin. *de fide* "Ineffabilis Deus"

The exact definition is as follows: "The most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin."


* The BVM was throughout her life actually exempt from every impulse of concupiscence. sent certa 72
* The BVM was by a special divine privilege actually exempt from personal sin. de fide 77 Trent VI, 23
##### The Blessed Virgin Mary remained a virgin her entire life. *de fide*


* Mary was a pure virgin before the birth of Christ. de fide
* The BVM remained in inviolate virgin in giving birth. de fide
* The BVM was spared the pains of childbirth. "Certain conclusion" 95
* The BVM remained a virgin after the birth of Christ. de fide 96 Constantinople VI (680) for all of the above except the pains

##### "The Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory." de fide Munificentissimus Deus

##### Mary actually died. *sent. communior.*

Although the definition of the Assumption is carefully worded to avoid saying that Mary died, only a small group of theologians doubt that she did. For a discussion, see Chapter 5 of Aidan Nichols' *There is No Rose*. Arguably the number of dissenters is small enough that this doctrine could be simply *sent. comm.*.
