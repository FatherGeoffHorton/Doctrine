### Chapter One: Man's Capacity for God
<!-- invisible article one and only --->
###### 1.1.1.1.1 God, our Creator and Lord, can be known with certainty by the natural light of reason from created things. *De fide*, Vatican I, *De Revelatione*, can. 1.
<!---##### The existence of God can be proved by means of causality. (Sent. fidei proxima.)--->

The Council did not specify how it is that God can be known with certainty. Ott labels it *sent. fidei proxima* that this can be done by means of causality (*Summa Theologica* I.2.3, *respondeo*, second way), and that is probably what the Council fathers had in mind, but the Tradition of the Church is not constant on the subject and the Council left the means undefined.

###### 1.1.1.1.2 God's existence is not merely an object of natural rational knowledge, but also an object of supernatural faith. (De fide.)

###### 1.1.1.1.3 Our natural knowledge of God in this world is not as immediate, intuitive cognition, but a mediate, abstractive knowledge, because it is attained through the knowledge of creatures. (Sent. certa.)

###### 1.1.1.1.4 Our knowledge of God here below is not proper (cognitio propia) but analogical (cognitio analoga or analogica). (Sent. certa.)

###### 1.2.1.1.1 There is only One God. (De fide.) Vat. I, *de Deo*, c. 1
<!---
* The One God is, in the ontological sense, The True God. (De fide.) (Vat. I, de Deo, c. 1) --->
###### 1.2.1.1.2 The Divine Attributes are really identical among themselves and with the Divine Essence. (De fide.)
###### 1.2.1.1.3 God is absolutely perfect. (De fide.)* [de fide, Vatican I, III, *De Fide* cap. 1] GKEA 182
###### 1.2.1.1.4 God is actually infinite in every perfection. (De fide.) [de fide; Nicaea II, Vatican I] GKEA 192
###### 1.2.1.1.5 God is absolutely simple. (De fide.) [de fide, Lateran IV, *Firmiter*; Vat I, *De Fide*, c. 1] GKEA 202

God is "simple" in that He is in no way composed of parts; the doctrine of the Trinity does not contradict this, as explained below. Some critics of Christianity erroneously suppose that "simple" means "easy to understand," which is not the meaning of "simple" in this context.

God's simplicity can be defined more explicitly by denying all the various forms of composition, as follows:

    * God is not composed of form and matter.
    * God is not composed of substance and accidents.
    * There is in God no composition of faculty and act.
    * There is in God no composition of really distinct activities.
    * There is in God no composition of subject and essence, nor of nature and person.
    * There is in God no composition of genus and specific difference.
    * There is in God no composition of essence and existence.
    
* God possesses an infinite power of cognition. (De fide.)
* God is absolute Veracity. (De fide.)
* God is absolutely faithful. (De fide.)
* God is absolute ontological Goodness in Himself and in relation to others. (De fide.)

* God's knowledge is infinite. (De fide.)
* God's knowledge is purely and simply actual.
* God's knowledge is subsistent
* God's knowledge is comprehensive * God's knowledge of the things outside Himself is an adequately comprehensive knowledge, and is invested with that absolute infallibility which flows from metaphysical certainty. de fide [?]' 343'
* God's knowledge is independent of extra-divine things * **By virtue of His infinite comprehension of His own Essence, God in and through Himself also knows all extra-divine truths, in such manner that truth is dependent on Him, not He on truth. 333 sent certa**
* The primary and formal object of the Divine Cognition is God Himself. (Scientia contemplationis) * **Because of the identity of being and thought in God, the Divine Knowledge is a substantial act of cognition, in which consciousness and self-comprehension coincide. de fide 329**
* God knows all that is merely possible by the knowledge of simple intelligence (scientia simplicis intelligentiae). (De fide.) God knows whatever is possible 351 de fide Although God perceives the purely possibles exactly as they are in themselves, He does not know them immediately in themselves, but mediately in His own Essence as medium in quo. sent comm 393
* God knows all real things in the past, the present and the future (Scientia visionis). (De fide.)
* By knowledge of vision (scientia visionis) God also foresees the free acts of the rational creatures with infallible certainty. (De fide.) God foreknows the future free actions of His intelligent creatures 361 De Deo
* God also knows the conditioned future free actions with infallible certainty (Scientia futuribilium). (Sent. communis.)
* God's Divine will is infinite. (De fide.)
* God loves Himself of necessity, but loves and wills the creation of extra-Divine things, on the other hand, with freedom. (De fide.) By virtue of His infinite love God loves whatever is good: Himself as the supreme good He loves with absolutely necessity, whereas whatever is good in His creatures He loves with a free will. de fide 428 De Deo
* God is almighty. (De fide.) * **God is omnipotent. More precisely, God can do whatever He can will, insofar as it is not repugnant to His Essence. GKEA 283 Nicence Creed, Firmiter;**
* God is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth. (De fide.) D 1782.
* God is infinitely just. (De fide.)
* God is infinitely merciful. (De fide.)

* God is not a body. *de fide* GKEA 291

* God perceives the actually existing things, including free actions, past and present, in His own Essence as medium in quo. sent comm 397
* Like God's conception of Himself, the love He has for Himself is really identical with His Essence. de fide 423
* Although God loves His creatures unequally, each according to the measure of its goodness, He does not love them for their sake, but solely because of His own goodness. Sent Comm. I don't like the phrasing. 434
* God loves all existing creatures with the love of simple complacency; those endowed with intelligence e also loves with the love of benevolence. Sent certa 442
* God loves all existing creatures with the love of simple complacency; those endowed with intelligence He also loves with the love of benevolence. Sent certa 442
* God can will natural evil, and evil inflicted as a punishment, only per accidens; He never wills sin, but merely permits it. 442; no rank given, but the permission part has to be sent certa at least
* God has no will with regard to what is intrinsically impossible. sent comm 452

      Paragraph 5. Heaven and Earth
* In the beginning of time God created spiritual essences (angels) out of nothing. (De fide.) * Angels exist.  *de fide* 313
* The nature of angels is spiritual. (De fide.) Angels are incorporeal substances, that is, pure spirits. *sent. certa* 314
	That angels are spirits is certain. This is affirmed in passing in Lateran IV's *Firmiter*, which, in the process of affirming God as creator of all, states: “who by His own omnipotent power at once from the beginning of time created each creature from nothing, spiritual, and corporal, namely, angelic and mundane, and finally the human, constituted as it were, alike of the spirit and the body.”[Old Denzinger translation] The first Vatican Council repeated this teaching in nearly identical language. Ott deemed this sufficient to assign a rank of *de fide* to this teaching, but Pohle/Preuss say that it is “Catholic doctrine, though not yet an article of faith.”[GANS 314] I have assigned it the lower rank of *sent. certa*, but note that it may possibly be higher.
* The angels are by nature immortal. (Sent. communis.)
* God set a supernatural final end for the angels, the immediate vision of God, and endowed them with sanctifying grace in order that they might achieve this end. (Sent. Certa.) * the Angels were endowed sanctifying grace at the time of their creation. 327 *sent. comm.*
* The primary task of the good angels is the glorification and the service of God. (Sent. certa.)
* The secondary task of the good angels is the protection of men and care for their salvation. (De fide on the ground of general teaching.) * The Angels exercise a kind of general guardianship over the human race. de fide 330
* Every one of the faithful has his own special guardian angel from baptism. (Sent. certa.) * every Christian from the moment of his baptism has his particular guardian angel. *sent. certa* 332
	* not only Christians and those justified, but heathens and sinners also have each a guardian angel.  *sent. certa*, though Ott doesn't say so in so many words

* Our first parents in paradise sinned grievously through transgression of the Divine probationary commandment. (De fide.) Trent, session 5, canons one through three
* Through the sin our first parents lost sanctifying grace and provoked the anger and the indignation of God.

* Original sin is transmitted by natural generation. (De fide.) * the sin of Adam is transferred by propagation. *de fide* Trent, session 5, Canon three page 280
* In the state of original sin man is deprived of sanctifying grace and all that this implies, as well as of the preternatural gifts of integrity. (De fide in regard to Sanctifying Grace and the Donum Immortalitatus. D788 et seq.)
* Souls who depart this life in the state of original sin are excluded from the Beatific Vision of God. (De fide.)
* The angels were subjected to a moral testing. (Sent. certa. as regards the fallen angels, Sent. communis as regards the good.) * Angels underwent a period of probation. 328
* The evil spirits (demons) were created good by God; they became evil through their own fault. de fide D428, 427

* The Divine and the human natures are united hypostatically in Christ, that is, joined to each other in one Person (De fide.)
  * (a) Christ Incarnate is a single, that is, a sole Person. He is God and man at the same time.
  * (b) The God-Logos is connected with the flesh by an inner, physical or substantial unification. Christ is not the bearer of God, but is God really.
  * (c) The human and the divine activities predicated of Christ in Holy Writ and in the Fathers may not be divided between two persons or hypostases, the Man-Christ and the God-Logos, but must be attributed to the one Christ, the Logos become Flesh. It is the Divine Logos, who suffered in the flesh, was crucified, died, and rose again.

* Not only as God but also as man Jesus Christ is the natural Son of God. (De fide.) OK
* The God-Man Jesus Christ is to be venerated with one single mode of Worship, the absolute Worship of Latria which is due to God alone. (De fide.) Ephesus, 8th anathema of St. Cyril; V Constantinople
* Just as Latria is due to the whole Human nature of Christ, so is it due to the individual parts of His nature. (Sent. Certa.)
* Christ's Divine and Human characteristics and activities are to be predicated of the one Word Incarnate. (De fide.)

The human soul of our Lord also possessed an accidental holiness (i.e., sanctifying grace) which, though not actually infinite, was by far the most perfect created in the present economy.
* Sanctifying Grace overflows from Christ, the Head, to the members of His mystical Body. (Sent. communis.)
* Christ's humanity, as instrument of the Logos, possesses the power of producing supernatural effects. (Sent. certa.)
* The Son of God became man in order to redeem men. (De fide.)
* Fallen man cannot redeem himself. (De fide.)
* God was not compelled to redeem mankind by either an internal or an external compulsion. (Sent. certa.)
* Even on the presupposition of the Divine Resolve of Redemption, the Incarnation was not absolutely necessary. (Sent. communis.)
* If God demanded a full atonement the Incarnation of a Divine Person was necessary. (Sent. communis.)
* Christ is the Supreme Prophet promised in the Old Covenant and the absolute teacher of humanity. (Sent. certa.)

    ARTICLE 2: THE PASCHAL MYSTERY IN THE CHURCH'S SACRAMENTS
* The Sacraments of the New Covenant are effective signs of grace instituted by Christ.
* The outward sign of the sacraments is composed of two essential parts, namely, thing and word (res et verbum or elementum et verbum). (Sent. fidei proxima.) * The sacraments of the New Testament consist of two elements, the one indeterminate (res), the other determining (verbum). Sent fidei prox. 59 * The "sensible element" in a Sacrament corresponds, in philosophical parlance, to "matter," the word to "form," and the two are related to each other as matter and form in the Scholastic sense of these terms. sent certa 61
* The Sacraments of the New Covenant contain the grace which they signify, and bestow it on those who do not hinder it. (De fide.)
* The Sacraments work ex opere operato. (De fide.)
* All the Sacraments of the New Covenant confer sanctifying grace on the receivers. (De fide.) Trent VII.7
* Each individual sacrament confers a specific sacramental grace. (Sent. communis.) * Besides sanctifying grace, each sacrament confers a special, so called "sacramental grace". sent comm 70
* Three Sacraments, Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders, imprint a character, that is, an indelible spiritual mark, and for this reason cannot be repeated. (De fide.) Trent VII, 9 77
* The Sacramental Character is a spiritual mark imprinted on the soul. (De fide.)
* The Sacramental Character confers the full power for the performance of acts of Christian Worship. (Sent. communis.)
* The Sacramental Character continues at least until the death of its bearer. (De fide.)
* All the Sacraments of the New Covenant were instituted by Jesus Christ. (De fide.) Christ Himself instituted all the sacraments in the sense that He alone, by His passion and death, is their meritorious cause. de fide Trent VII.1 97
* Christ instituted all the Sacraments immediately and personally. (Sent. certa.) * The Sacraments of the Christian dispensation have been immediately and personally instituted by Christ. sent certa 101
* Christ fixed the substance of the Sacraments. The Church has no power to alter them. (Sent. certa.)* Christ so determined the matter and form of the Sacraments that they are immutable for all time. sent comm 107 discussion of of what level of determination this means
* There are Seven Sacraments of the New Law. (De fide.) Trent VII.1
* God can communicate grace even without the Sacraments. (Sent. certa.)
* The Sacraments of the New Covenant are necessary for the salvation of mankind. (De fide.)
* The primary minister of the Sacraments is the God-Man Jesus Christ. (Sent. certa.)
* The secondary minister of the Sacrament is man in the wayfaring state. (Sent. communis). 163
* The validity and efficacy of the Sacrament is independent of the minister's orthodoxy and state of grace. Constance (DB 584) Trent VII.12 de fide
* For the valid dispensing of the Sacraments it is necessary that the minister accomplish the Sacramental Sign in the proper manner. (De fide.)
* The minister must further have the intention at least of doing what the Church does. (De fide.) Trent VII.11 A merely external intention (the intention of performing the external rite without giving interior assent) is not sufficient. sent comm 183
* Only a person in the wayfaring state can validly receive a Sacrament. (Sent. communis.)  A person must be in the wayfaring state to receive a sacrament. sent certa.
* Excepting the Sacrament of Penance, neither orthodox belief nor moral worthiness is necessary for the validity of the Sacrament, on the part of the recipient. (Sent. communis.) * The validity of a sacrament does not depend on the orthodox belief of the minister. de fide wrt Baptism; sent fidei proxima wrt to others, except penance 171
* For the validity of the Sacraments in the case of adult recipients the intention of receiving the Sacrament is necessary. (Sent. certa.) * An adult [person over the age of reason] must intend to receive the sacrament for it to be valid. sent certa? 197
* In the case of adult recipients moral worthiness is necessary for the worthy or fruitful reception of the Sacraments. (De fide.)
* The Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders[1], when they are received validly but unworthily, revive after the removal of the moral indisposition, that is, the sacramental grace is conferred subsequently. (Sent. communis.)
* The Old Testament Sacraments wrought, ex opere operato, not grace, but merely an external lawful purity. (Sent. certa.) * There was a "Sacrament of Nature" under the pre-Mosaic dispensation by which men could be saved, though the nature of this "sacrament" is uncertain. sent certa 20 * Circumcision was a sacrament of the Mosaic Law 26
* The minister of a sacrament must be duly qualified. 164 Trent VII.10

SECTION TWO: THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH

  CHAPTER ONE: THE SACRAMENTS OF CHRISTIAN INITIATION

    ARTICLE 1: THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM
* Baptism is a true Sacrament instituted by Jesus Christ. (De fide.)
* The materia remota of the Sacrament of Baptism is true and natural water. (De fide.) Trent VII.2
* The materia proxima of the Sacrament of Baptism is the ablution, by physical contact, of the body with water. (Sent. certa.)
* The form of Baptism consists in the words of the minister which accompany it and more closely determine it.
* Baptism confers the grace of justification. (De fide.)
	* Baptism remits the guilt of Original Sin. de fide Trent V.5
	* Baptism remits the guilt of all actual sins.
* Baptism effects the remission of all punishments of sin, both the eternal and the temporal. (De fide.) Trent V.5
* Even if it be unworthily received, valid Baptism imprints on the soul of the recipient an indelible spiritual mark, the Baptismal Character, and for this reason, the Sacrament cannot be repeated. (De fide.)
* Baptism by water (Baptismus fluminis) is, since the promulgation of the Gospel, necessary for all men without exception, for salvation. (De fide.) * Baptism is necessary for salvation. de fide 238 Trent VII.5 necesity of precept and necessity of means. WHen?
* In case of emergency Baptism by water can be replaced by Baptism of desire or Baptism by blood proximate In adults the place of Baptism by water can be supplied in case of urgent necessity by the so-called Baptism of desire. *doctrina catholica?* 243 Trent VI 4, XIV 4 St. Ambrose de Obitu Valent 51 More common opinion holds that an implicit desire is sufficient Martyrdom can also supply the place of Baptism *sent certa* D796

* Baptism can be received by any person in the wayfaring state who is not already baptised. (De fide.)

    ARTICLE 2: THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION
* Confirmation is a true Sacrament properly so-called. (De fide.) VII.1
* The form of Confirmation consists in the words which the minister speaks when he imposes his hands on the recipient and anoints his forehead. (Sent. communis.) * Form is of dispute  * general prayer  * words at anointing
	* Matter of confirmation is undefined;
	  * laying on of hands
  		* anointing with chrism
  		* both
		* Balsam is required; sent communior
* As a Sacrament of the living, Confirmation effects (per se) an increase of Sanctifying Grace. (Sent. certa.)
* The specific operation of Confirmation is the perfection of Baptismal Grace. (Sent. communis.)
* Confirmation imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark, and for this reason, cannot be repeated. (De fide.)
* A baptised person can achieve eternal salvation even without Confirmation. (Sent. fidei proxima.)
* The ordinary minister of Confirmation is the Bishop alone. (De fide.) Trent VII.3, but note the eastern disagreement
* The extraordinary minister of Confirmation is a priest on whom this full power is conferred by the common law or by a special apostolic indult. (Sent. certa.)
* Confirmation can be received by any baptised person who is not already confirmed. (Sent. certa.)
* The repetition of Confirmation is invalid and grievously sinful. Is this really a prop in its own right?

    ARTICLE 3: THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST
* The Body and Blood of Jesus Christ are truly, really and substantially present in the Eucharist. (De fide.) The Eucharist really, truly, and substantially contains the Body and Blood, together with the Soul and the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and consequently the whole Christ.  *de fide* 88 Trent 13, Canon one
* Christ becomes present in the Sacrament of the Altar by the transformation of the whole substance of the bread into His Body and the whole substance of the wine into His Blood. (De fide.) * By the consecration of the bread and of the wine a conversion is made of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the Body of Christ our Lord, and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of His Blood; which conversion is by the Holy Catholic Church suitably and properly called Transubstantiation. de fide Trent 13 Chapter 4 page 11
* The Accidents of bread and wine continue after the change of the substance. (De fide.)
* The Sacramental Accidents retain their physical reality after the change of the substance. (Sent. certa.)
* The Sacramental Accidents continue without a subject in which to inhere. (Sent. certa.)
* The Body and the Blood of Christ together with His Soul and His Divinity and therefore the Whole Christ are truly present in the Eucharist (De fide.)
* The Whole Christ is present under each of the two Species. (De fide.) Trent session 13 Chapter 3
* When either consecrated species is divided the Whole Christ is present in each part of the species. (De fide.) When the Sacred Host is broken into pieces or the consecrated contents of the Chalice are consumed in small quantities, Christ is wholly and entirely present in each particle and in every drop. de fide Trent 13, Canon three page 95
	* Even before the actual division of the sacred species Christ is wholly and entirely present in each particle of the Host and in every drop of the collective contents of the Chalice. theological conclusion? Page 98.
* After the Consecration has been completed the Body and Blood are permanently present in the Eucharist. (De fide.) Trent team Three (?!)
* The Worship of Adoration (latria) must be given to Christ present in the Eucharist. (De fide.)
* The Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist is a mystery of Faith. (Sent. certa.)
* The Eucharist is a true Sacrament instituted by Christ. (De fide.)
* The matter for the consummation of the Eucharist is bread and wine. (De fide.)
	* Wheat bread is required to confect the Eucharist. sent certa see CDF statements on attempts to use rice
	* Leavened and unleavened bread are both possible (though licit only in ther respective Churches) sent *sent. certa*
	* Wine from grapes is required to confect the Eucharist. sent *sent. certa*  (cf. Trent XIII cap 4)
	* Addition of water is not necessary
	The bread used for the Host must be made from wheat with no other grain included. According to the CDF[24 July 2003, Prot. N. 89/78], bread requires the presence of at least a trace of gluten, so hosts that are entirely gluten free are invalid matter.

	In the Latin Rite, the bread must be unleavened. Eastern Rite Churches use leavened bread, so addition of whatever is required for leavening does not make the bread invalid.

	Wine must be from grapes and not adulterated (except by the small amount of water added during Mass) nor distilled. *Mustum*, which refers to grape juice that is freshly pressed or otherwise preserved from fermentation (presumably without adulteration) is valid matter, but should be used only for grave reasons [cf. CDWDS note of June 15, 2017, Prot. N. 320/17].

	The addition of water to the principal chalice at Mass is not necessary for validity, though it is wrong to omit it.
* The form of the Eucharist consists in Christ's Words of institution, uttered at the Consecration. (Sent. certa.) * By the articulate utterance, on the part of the priest, of the words of institution: "This is my Body, ... this is my Blood," Christ becomes immediately present on the altar. sent fidei proxima Trent XIII cap 3 * The words of institution contain the only and wholly adequate form of the Eucharist, and consequently the epiclesis does not consecrate and is not part of the form of the Sacrament.  *sent. certa*
* The Chief fruit of the Eucharist is an intrinsic union of the recipient with Christ. (Sent. certa.)
* The Eucharist, as food for the soul, preserves and increases the supernatural life of the soul. (Sent. certa. )
* The Eucharist is a pledge of heavenly bliss and of the future resurrection of the body. (Sent. certa.)
* For children before the age of reason the reception of the Eucharist is not necessary for salvation. (De fide.) * In the case of infants the Holy Eucharist is not necessary for salvation either as a means or by way of precept *sent. certa*  Trent XXI, can 4
* For adults the reception of the Eucharist is necessary for salvation with the necessity of precept (necessitate praecepti).
