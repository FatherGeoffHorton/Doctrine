The following statements are all based on the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed. They were affirmed at subsequent Councils, most notably Lateran IV in its decree *Firmiter*.

##### God is one; there is only one God. *de fide*

In general, this doctrine stands opposed to polytheism, the belief that there is more than one divine being. In the specific context of the Trinity, this doctrine stands opposed to the idea that each of the Divine Persons is a distinct deity, with the three gods somehow joined together in extrinsic unity.

##### God is omnipotent (almighty). *de fide*

God can do anything which is not inherently contradictory. The qualifying phrase is necessary because of conundrums such as the question, "Can God create a square circle?" The answer is that He cannot, not because His power is limited but because "square circle" is a self-contradictory phrase that cannot refer to anything--it is meaningless. Theologians enumerate a list of five things God cannot do, each of which contains an internal contradiction:

* Bring about any blatant contradiction, such as the aforementioned square circle;
* Change the past, which would be making something both be and not be;
* Commit sin, and this is impossible for two reasons:
    * Sin is a lack of perfection in action (God's perfection is covered beginning on page #PAGEREF);
    * God is substantial goodness, to which sin is diametrically opposed.
* Cease to exist in any way;
* Revoke His free decrees.

##### God created all things from nothing (*ex nihilo*). *de fide*

This doctrine encompasses two truths.

First, God is distinct from His creation, in contrast to *pantheism* and *panentheism*, each of which in its own way identifies God with the whole of Creation.

Second, God creates. Although the word "make" is used to describe God's act of creation (for example, in the Apostles' Creed), and rightly so when properly understood, the word "create" is a more accurate description. One *makes* something from existing parts, but one *creates* something that did not previously exist. When God is referring to as "making" something, we must understand this as referring to an act of creation.

The portion of the Creed dealing with the Incarnation will be addressed separately under the heading of the Incarnation.

##### The Son, the second Person of the Trinity, is uniquely begotten by the Father. *de fide*

The Son is begotten, neither made nor created. To *beget* in general, is to communicate life to another. Since the life that is communicated in this case is the divine life, the Son is of the same substance as His Father (see below). This divine life is communicated only once in this way, so there is only one Son.

##### The Son is of the same substance (consubtantial) as the Father. *de fide*

The proximate cause of the First Council of Nicaea was the denial of this proposition by the Arians. They held that the Son was the highest created being, of *like* substance (Greek: homoiousios) to the Father. The Creed states that the Son is of the *same* substance (Greek: homoousious) as the Father. The Creed affirms this in several ways ("God from God etc."), each intended to close off an ambiguity that could be exploited by the Arians.

##### The Holy Spirit is consubstantial with the Father and the Son. *de fide*

Although this is not explicitly stated in the Creed, the Holy Spirit is given the title "Lord," as are the Father and the Son, and the Holy Spirit is entitled to the same adoration and glory as the Father and the Son.

We proceed to doctrines about the Trinity not contained in the Creed.

##### The only real distinction between the Divine Persons is that of their mutual relationships. *de fide*
