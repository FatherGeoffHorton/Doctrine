## Introduction

For decades, Ludwig Ott's *Fundamentals of Christian Doctrine* has been the go-to book for anyone who wants to find what the Catholic Church teaches on various topics, and with what levels of definitiveness. It is still a useful reference, but it has three (at least) serious flaws:

* It has not been updated since it was published. It does not include anything from the Second Vatican Council, nor anything from any of the popes after Pope Pius XII.
* Some of Dr. Ott's statements in explanation of doctrines are seriously incomplete or misleading.
* It's fairly expensive.

Not without trepidation, I have embarked on a project to address these flaws. I am doing my best to include all the relevant information. I will work strenuously not to close off discussions that the Church has left open. I will make the result available inexpensively in electronic form.

For each doctrinal statement, I have given my best estimate of the level of certainty with which it must be held (see the section below on Levels of Certainty). When there is reasonable doubt over the level of certainty with which a given doctrine is taught, I have chosen the lowest defensible level.

For doctrines which have been formally defined by the Magisterium of the Church, I have provided a citation to that formal definition.

For many doctrines, I have provided brief discussion giving definitions of technical terms so that it is clear what is being taught. I have also provided a few pertinent Scripture references when it seemed helpful for me to do so. Beyond this, I have not attempted to defend doctrines nor to give a history of their development.

When possible, I have provided references to the *Catechism of the Catholic Church*.
