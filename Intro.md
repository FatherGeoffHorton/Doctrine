## Introduction

For decades, Ludwig Ott's *Fundamentals of Christian Doctrine* has been the go-to book for anyone who wants to find what the Catholic Church teaches on various topics, and with what levels of definitiveness. It is still a useful reference, but it has three (at least) serious flaws:

* It has not been updated since it was published. It does not include anything from the Second Vatican Council, nor anything from any of the popes after Pope Pius XII.
* Some of Dr. Ott's statements in explanation of doctrines are seriously incomplete or misleading.
* It's fairly expensive.

Not without trepidation, I have embarked on a project to address these flaws. I am doing my best to include all the relevant information. I will work strenuously not to close off discussions that the Church has left open. I will make the result available inexpensively in electronic form.
