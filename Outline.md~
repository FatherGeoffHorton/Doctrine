* The nature of angels is spiritual. (De fide.) Angels are incorporeal substances, that is, pure spirits. *sent. certa* 314
	That angels are spirits is certain. This is affirmed in passing in Lateran IV's *Firmiter*, which, in the process of affirming God as creator of all, states: “who by His own omnipotent power at once from the beginning of time created each creature from nothing, spiritual, and corporal, namely, angelic and mundane, and finally the human, constituted as it were, alike of the spirit and the body.”[Old Denzinger translation] The first Vatican Council repeated this teaching in nearly identical language. Ott deemed this sufficient to assign a rank of *de fide* to this teaching, but Pohle/Preuss say that it is “Catholic doctrine, though not yet an article of faith.”[GANS 314] I have assigned it the lower rank of *sent. certa*, but note that it may possibly be higher.
* The angels are by nature immortal. (Sent. communis.) 
* God set a supernatural final end for the angels, the immediate vision of God, and endowed them with sanctifying grace in order that they might achieve this end. (Sent. Certa.) * the Angels were endowed sanctifying grace at the time of their creation. 327 *sent. comm.* 
* The primary task of the good angels is the glorification and the service of God. (Sent. certa.)
* The secondary task of the good angels is the protection of men and care for their salvation. (De fide on the ground of general teaching.) * The Angels exercise a kind of general guardianship over the human race. de fide 330
* Every one of the faithful has his own special guardian angel from baptism. (Sent. certa.) * every Christian from the moment of his baptism has his particular guardian angel. *sent. certa* 332
	* not only Christians and those justified, but heathens and sinners also have each a guardian angel.  *sent. certa*, though Ott doesn't say so in so many words

      Paragraph 7. The Fall
* Our first parents in paradise sinned grievously through transgression of the Divine probationary commandment. (De fide.) Trent, session 5, canons one through three
* Through the sin our first parents lost sanctifying grace and provoked the anger and the indignation of God. (De fide.) by transgressing the law of probation Adam forfeited sanctifying grace and merited eternal damnation; he became subject to bodily death and the dominion of Satan, and suffered a deterioration in body and soul.  *de fide* Trent, session 5, Canon one 236
* Our first parents became subject to death and to the dominion of the Devil. (De fide.) D788. see above 
* Adam's sin is transmitted to his posterity, not by imitation, but by descent. (De fide.) * the sin of Adam is transferred by propagation. *de fide* Trent, session 5, Canon three page 280
* Original Sin consists in the deprivation of grace caused by the free act of sin committed by the head of the race. (Sent. communis.) * Original Sin essentially consists im privation of grace, so far as this is voluntary in all men to the will of their progenitor. *sent. comm.*
* Original sin is transmitted by natural generation. (De fide.) * the sin of Adam is transferred by propagation. *de fide* Trent, session 5, Canon three page 280
* In the state of original sin man is deprived of sanctifying grace and all that this implies, as well as of the preternatural gifts of integrity. (De fide in regard to Sanctifying Grace and the Donum Immortalitatus. D788 et seq.)
* Souls who depart this life in the state of original sin are excluded from the Beatific Vision of God. (De fide.)
* The angels were subjected to a moral testing. (Sent. certa. as regards the fallen angels, Sent. communis as regards the good.) * Angels underwent a period of probation. 328 
* The evil spirits (demons) were created good by God; they became evil through their own fault. de fide D428, 427
* the fallen Angels lost grace and were cast into hell, where they have no hope of redemption. *de fide*
* The Devil possesses a certain dominion over mankind by reason of Adam's sin. (De fide.)
