1.1.1

31-32, 36:
###### The existence of God can be known with certainty by natural reason from the consideration of created things.

*De fide*, Vatican I, *De Revelatione*, can. 1.
<!---##### The existence of God can be proved by means of causality. (Sent. fidei proxima.)--->

The Council did not specify how it is that God can be known with certainty. Ott labels it *sent. fidei proxima* that this can be done by means of causality (*Summa Theologica* I.2.3, *respondeo*, second way), and that is probably what the Council fathers had in mind, but the Tradition of the Church is not constant on the subject and the Council left the means undefined.

40-43:
###### Our knowledge of God while in the present life is analogical, not proper.
*Sent. certa.*

That is to say, we know God by way of comparison to created things; we do not know God as He is in Himself.

###### God is incomprehensible, even to the Elect in Heaven.
*De fide*, D 418, 782

This means that we cannot come to a full and complete (comprehensive) knowledge of God. It does not mean that we are incapable of knowing or understanding anything about God.

The blessed in Heaven possess an immediate intuitive knowledge of the Divine Essence. de fide
The immediate vision of God transcends the natural power of cognition of the human soul, and is therefore supernatural. de fide
The soul, for the immediate vision of God, requires the light of glory. de fide D 475

1.1.2.1

50:
###### God's existence is not merely an object of rational knowledge, but also an object of supernatural faith.
*De fide* Ott

65-66:
###### General revelation ended with the death of the last Apostle.
*Sent. certa.*; *Dei Verbum* IV.

1.1.2.2

75-82:
###### Divine revelation is contained in both Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition. *Sent. certa.*; *Trent* sess. 4; *Dei Verbum* IX.

###### The Church has divine authority to interpret both Scripture and Tradition. *Sent. certa.*; *Dei Verbum* X.

See the discussion of infallibility below for the ways in which this authority can be exercised.

1.1.2.3

###### Sacred Scripture is inspired by God.
*Sent. certa.*; *Trent*, sess. 4; *Dei Verbum* XI.

The Church is not committed to any particular theory of inspiration.

###### Sacred Scripture when properly understood is without error in all that it affirms.
*Sent. certa.*; *Dei Verbum* XI.

###### The inspired books of Sacred Scripture are: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, Esther (including those portions know as "the Rest of Esther"), 1 and 2 Maccabees, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel (including the Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children; Susannah and the elders; Bel and the Dragon), Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts of the Apostles, Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2 and 3 John, Jude,  Revelation (the Apocalypse).
*De fide*; *Trent* sess. 4.

It is certain that the books in the above list are inspired. A few other books are regarded as Scripture by various groups of Eastern Christians, including groups in Communion with the Holy See. The Magisterium has not give a definite resolution to the question.

1.2.1.1

200
###### There is only one God in the proper sense of the term.
*De fide*., Vat. I *De Deo*, cap. 1.

215-217
###### God is true and faithful.
*Sent. certa.*

218-221
###### God is benevolent.
*Sent. certa.*

249-256
###### In God there are three Divine Persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
*De fide*.
The most common definition of *person* is *an individual substance of a rational nature.*

###### Each of the three Persons possesses the one (numerical) Divine Essence.
*De fide*.
This means that each of the Divine Persons is fully and completely God, not a part of God. For this reason, analogies of the Trinity involving combination or addition (e.g., 1 + 1 + 1 = 1) are best avoided.

###### The Divine Persons are truly distinct from each other.
*De fide*.
This doctrine stands against the idea that the Persons are simply modes in which God acts.
In God there are two internal divine processions. de fide
The Divine Persons, not the Divine Nature, are the subject of the internal divine processions (in the active and in the passive sense). de fide D432
The Second Divine Person proceeds from the First Divine Person by generation, and therefore is related to Him as Son to Father. de fide
The Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and from the Son as from a single principle through a single spiration. de fide
The Son proceeds from the Intellect of the Father by way of generation. sent. certa
The Holy Ghost proceeds from the will or from the mutual love of the Father and the Son. sent. certa
The Holy Ghost does not proceed through generation but through spiration. de fide
The relations in God are really identical with the Divine Nature. de fide D703
The Three Divine Persons are in one another. de fide
All the ad extra activities of God are common to the three Persons. de fide Firmiter
The Father sends the Son; the Father and the Son send the Holy Ghost. sent. certa D277/794
The Trinity of God can be known only through divine revelation. Proximate
