1.1.1

31-32, 36:
###### The existence of God can be known with certainty by natural reason from the consideration of created things.

*De fide*, Vatican I, *De Revelatione*, can. 1.
<!---##### The existence of God can be proved by means of causality. (Sent. fidei proxima.)--->

The Council did not specify how it is that God can be known with certainty. Ott labels it *sent. fidei proxima* that this can be done by means of causality (*Summa Theologica* I.2.3, *respondeo*, second way), and that is probably what the Council fathers had in mind, but the Tradition of the Church is not constant on the subject and the Council left the means undefined.

40-43:
###### Our knowledge of God while in the present life is analogical, not proper.
*Sent. certa.*

That is to say, we know God by way of comparison to created things; we do not know God as He is in Himself.

###### God is incomprehensible, even to the Elect in Heaven.
*De fide*, D 418, 782

This means that we cannot come to a full and complete (comprehensive) knowledge of God. It does not mean that we are incapable of knowing or understanding anything about God.

1.1.2.1

50:
###### God's existence is not merely an object of rational knowledge, but also an object of supernatural faith.
*De fide* Ott

65-66:
###### General revelation ended with the death of the last Apostle.
*Sent. certa.*; *Dei Verbum* IV.

1.1.2.2

75-82:
###### Divine revelation is contained in both Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition. *Sent. certa.*; *Trent* sess. 4; *Dei Verbum* IX.

###### The Church has divine authority to interpret both Scripture and Tradition. *Sent. certa.*; *Dei Verbum* X.

See the discussion of infallibility below for the ways in which this authority can be exercised.

1.1.2.3

###### Sacred Scripture is inspired by God. *Sent. certa.*; *Trent*, sess. 4; *Dei Verbum* XI.

The Church is not committed to any particular theory of inspiration.

###### Sacred Scripture when properly understood is without error in all that it affirms. *Sent. certa.*; *Dei Verbum* XI.

###### The inspired books of Sacred Scripture are: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, Esther (including those portions know as "the Rest of Esther"), 1 and 2 Maccabees, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel (including the Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children; Susannah and the elders; Bel and the Dragon), Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts of the Apostles, Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2 and 3 John, Jude,  Revelation (the Apocalypse). *De fide*; *Trent* sess. 4.

It is certain that the books in the above list are inspired. A few other books are regarded as Scripture by various groups of Eastern Christians, including groups in Communion with the Holy See. The Magisterium has not give a definite resolution to the question.
