3.1.1.3

1739:
###### Even after the Fall, mankind has full freedom of choice between good and evil.
*De fide*, Trent sess. 6, cann. 5-6.

1742, 2002:
###### The will remains free under the effect of grace.
*De fide*, Trent sess. 6, can. 4.

Because so much confusion surrounds the interaction of grace and free will, it is worth quoting canon 4 in full:
  >  If anyone says that man's free will moved and aroused by God, by assenting to God's call and action, in no way cooperates toward disposing and preparing itself to obtain the grace of justification, that it cannot refuse its assent if it wishes, but that, as something inanimate, it does nothing whatever and is merely passive, let him be anathema.

3.1.3.2

The following statements are touched on throughout CCC 1987-2011.

###### There is such a thing as merely sufficient grace.
*De fide*, Trent FIXME

*Sufficient grace* is grace that would bring about conversion in a sinner if his will did not resist. *Merely sufficient grace* is grace that does not actually bring about the conversion of a sinner, as opposed to *efficacious grace*, which does result in conversion.

###### Even pagans and those not in a state of grace are able to perform naturally good acts without the assistance of grace.

###### Not all acts performed outside a state of grace are sinful.
Both of these are *De fide*, Trent sess. 6, can. 7. Cf.  *Unigenitus*, second condemned proposition.

###### Actual grace is absolutely necessary for every salvific act.
###### Grace is absolutely necessary for every single act required for justification.
Both of these are *De fide*, Council of Orange, cann. 3-8; Trent sess. 6, can. 1-3.

###### Prevenient grace is absolutely necessary not only for faith but for the very beginning of faith.
*De fide*, Council of Orange, can. 5.

###### Even for someone in the state of grace, actual grace is absolutely necessary for every act meriting salvation.
*De fide*, Trent sess. 6, cann. 1-2.

###### Without a special gift of grace, even a justified person cannot avoid even venial sin.
*De fide*, Trent sess. 6, can. 23.

###### Without special help from God, the just cannot persevere in righteousness.
*De fide*, Trent sess. 6, can. 23

###### Neither the initial grace of justification nor any of the subsequent graces can be merited in strict justice.
*De fide*, Trent sess. 6, cap. 5.

###### No naturally good work can establish even an equitable claim to to grace.
*Sent. fidei proxima*, Orange FIXME

###### Even natural prayer (that is, prayer unaided by grace) cannot merit grace.
*Sent. fidei proxima*, Orange FIXME

###### Man cannot move God to dispose grace by any action or predisposition.
*Sent. certa.*

###### Man can prepare himself for the reception of grace by not placing obstacles in its way.
*Sent. communior* DELETE?
