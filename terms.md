*Accidental, accidentally*: These terms do not refer to things occurring by happenstance. Rather, they refer to the properties a thing has that can change without changing what it is; for example, a chair can be stained or painted red or yellow, etc.; the way in which it is finished does not affect whether or not it is a chair. The color/stain etc. is an accidental property of the chair, not a necessary one.
