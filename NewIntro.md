#### Rationale

For decades, Ludwig Ott's *Fundamentals of Christian Dogma* has been to go-to book for anyone who wants to know exactly what the Catholic Church teaches on a given subject. However, it is expensive and bulky, it is not available in electronic form, and its discussion of some topics (for example, the perpetual virginity of the Blessed Virgin Mary) is unfortunate.

Another source for finding Catholic teaching is the *Catechism of the Catholic Church*. While this is an immensely useful work, not everything it contains is of equal level of certainty. Some of the things it says are defined doctrines of the faith; some are certainly true, though not defined; some are theological consensuses on which legitimate disagreement is possible; and some areas of theology are treated lightly or not at all.

I prepared the present work to address some of the above-listed shortcomings. It is short, in part because I have not attempted to cover any doctrines that are not at least a theological consensus (there may be a few exceptions). The items here are placed in an order that roughly parallels the *CCC*, which will help those who wonder what the level of authority attached to a given teaching is. (Levels of certainty are defined later in this introduction.)

#### Audience

This is not a textbook to teach philosophy or theology. Readers will need to be familiar with the basic concepts and terminology of these fields.

#### Procedure

The list of doctrines here comes from two primary sources. The first source is Ott, including only those doctrines he rated as "sent. comm." or greater. The second source is the series of theology textbooks by Joseph Pohle and Arthur Preuss; these are freely available online. Besides these sources, I consulted a few more specialized works listed in the bibliography, and I added a few items from the *CCC* or from my own awareness that an important topic was not otherwise covered.

For each listed doctrine, I have given the *lowest* defensible level of certainty. Some will doubtless argue that I should have given one doctrine or another more certainty, but I do not wish to invoke the authority of the Church in error.

I am confident that every doctrine listed in this book is taught by the Church with at least the level of authority I have assigned. I am also confident that the Church teaches things that I have not mentioned at all--in fact, I am not sure that an absolutely complete listing is a feasible project at all. As a result, a reader should **not** draw the conclusion that the Church has no teaching on a topic based solely on the fact that it is not covered here.

Some topics needed to be addressed but didn't fit well under any particular definition or discussion. For these topics, I have prepared brief excurses, set apart from the main text.

#### Levels of certainty

To make it easier to compare items listed in this book with those listed elsewhere, I have retained the traditional terminology.

* *De fide* doctrines are those taught by the Church as being definitively true and part of the Deposit of Faith. Catholics are required to affirm *de fide* doctrines on pain of heresy.
* *Sent. prox. (from the Latin *sententia proxima [fidei]) doctrines are not themselves part of the Deposit of Faith, but are so closely connected with them logically that a contrary doctrine cannot be held without implicitly denying a *de fide* doctrine.
* *Sent. certa* (from the Latin *sententia certa*) doctrines are definitely true but not formally defined. Contrary doctrines are definitely false but do not fall in the category of heresy.
* *Sent. comm." (from the Latin *sententia communis*) are teachings on which there is a theological consensus. While they technically belong to the realm of free opinion, holding a contrary doctrine is almost always rash.
* Lower levels of certainty are *sent. communior* (more common opinion) and its synonym *sent. probabilis* (probable opinion); *sent. probabilior* (more probably opinion, as opposed to less probable); *bene fundata* (well-founded); pia (pious); tolerata (tolerated). I have generally avoided referring to these levels in the course of this work.
