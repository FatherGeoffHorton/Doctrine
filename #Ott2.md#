* The Body and Blood of Jesus Christ are truly, really and substantially present in the Eucharist. (De fide.) The Eucharist really, truly, and substantially contains the Body and Blood, together with the Soul and the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and consequently the whole Christ.  *de fide* 88 Trent 13, Canon one
* Christ becomes present in the Sacrament of the Altar by the transformation of the whole substance of the bread into His Body and the whole substance of the wine into His Blood. (De fide.) * By the consecration of the bread and of the wine a conversion is made of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the Body of Christ our Lord, and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of His Blood; which conversion is by the Holy Catholic Church suitably and properly called Transubstantiation. de fide Trent 13 Chapter 4 page 11

	* Wine from grapes is required to confect the Eucharist. sent *sent. certa*  (cf. Trent XIII cap 4)
	* Addition of water is not necessary
	The bread used for the Host must be made from wheat with no other grain included. According to the CDF[24 July 2003, Prot. N. 89/78], bread requires the presence of at least a trace of gluten, so hosts that are entirely gluten free are invalid matter.
	
	In the Latin Rite, the bread must be unleavened. Eastern Rite Churches use leavened bread, so addition of whatever is required for leavening does not make the bread invalid.
	
	Wine must be from grapes and not adulterated (except by the small amount of water added during Mass) nor distilled. *Mustum*, which refers to grape juice that is freshly pressed or otherwise preserved from fermentation (presumably without adulteration) is valid matter, but should be used only for grave reasons [cf. CDWDS note of June 15, 2017, Prot. N. 320/17].
	
	The addition of water to the principal chalice at Mass is not necessary for validity, though it is wrong to omit it.
