All that exists outside God was, in its whole substance, produced out of nothing by God.
God was moved by His goodness to create the world.
The world was created for the glorification of God.
The Three Divine Persons are one single, common principle of creation.
God created the world free from exterior compulsion and inner necessity.
God has created a good world.
The world had a beginning in time.
God alone created the world.
God keeps all created things in existence.
God, through His Providence, protects and guides all that He has created.
The first man was created by God.
Man consists of two essential parts - a material body and a spiritual soul.
The rational soul per se is the essential form of the body.
Every human being possesses an individual soul.
God has conferred on man a supernatural destiny.
Our first parents, before the fall, were endowed with sanctifying grace.
In addition to sanctifying grace, our first parents were endowed with the preternatural gift of bodily immortality.
Our first parents in Paradise sinned grievously through transgression of the Divine probationary commandment.
Through sin our first parents lost sanctifying grace and provoked the anger and the indignation of God.
Our first parents became subject to death and to the dominion of the devil.
Adam's sin is transmitted to his posterity, not by imitation but by descent.
Original sin is transmitted by natural generation.
In the state of original sin man is deprived of sanctifying grace and all that this implies, as well as of the preternatural gifts of integrity.
Souls who depart this life in the state of original sin are excluded from the Beatific Vision of God.
In the beginning of time God created spiritual essences (angels) out of nothing.
The nature of angels is spiritual.
The evil spirits (demons) were created good by God; they became evil through their own fault.
The secondary task of the good angels is the protection of men and care for their salvation.
The devil possesses a certain dominion over mankind by reason of Adam's sin.

III. God the Redeemer

Jesus Christ is true God and true Son of God.
Christ assumed a real body, not an apparent body.
Christ assumed not only a body but also a rational soul.
Christ was truly generated and born of a daughter of Adam, the Virgin Mary.
The Divine and human natures are united hypostatically in Christ, that is, joined to each other in one Person.
In the hypostatic union each of the two natures of Christ continues unimpaired, untransformed, and unmixed with each other.
Each of the two natures in Christ possesses its own natural will and its own natural mode of operation.
The hypostatic union of Christ's human nature with the Divine Logos took place at the moment of conception.
The hypostatic union was effected by the three Divine Persons acting in common.
Only the second Divine Person became Man.
Not only as God but also as man Jesus Christ is the natural Son of God.
The God-Man Jesus Christ is to be venerated with one single mode of worship, the absolute worship of latria which is due to God alone.
Christ's Divine and human characteristics and activities are to be predicated of the one Word Incarnate.
Christ was free from all sin, from original sin as well as from all personal sin.
Christ's human nature was passable.
The Son of God became man in order to redeem men.
Fallen man cannot redeem himself.
The God-man Jesus Christ is a high priest.
Christ offered Himself on the Cross as a true and proper sacrifice.
Christ by His sacrifice on the Cross has ransomed us and reconciled us with God.
Christ, through His passion and death, merited award from God.
After His death, Christ's Soul, which was separated from His Body, descended into the underworld.
On the third day after His death, Christ rose gloriously from the dead.
Christ ascended body and soul into Heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father.

V. God the Sanctifier

There is a supernatural intervention of God in the faculties of the soul, which precedes the free act of the will.
There is a supernatural influence of God in the faculties of the soul which coincides in time with man's free act of will.
For every salutary act, internal supernatural grace of God (gratia elevans) is absolutely necessary.
Internal supernatural grace is absolutely necessary for the beginning of faith and salvation.
Without the special help of God, the justified cannot persevere to the end in justification.
The justified person is not able for his whole life long to avoid sins, even venial sins, without the special privilege of the grace of God.
Even in the fallen state, man can, by his natural intellectual power, know religious and moral truths.
For the performance of a morally good action, sanctifying grace is not required.
In the state of fallen nature, it is morally impossible for man without supernatural Revelation, to know easily, with absolute certainty, and without admixture of error, all religious and moral truths of the natural order.
Grace cannot be merited by natural works either de condigno or de congruo.
God gives all the just sufficient grace for the observation of the divine commandments.
God, by His eternal resolve of Will, has predetermined certain men to eternal blessedness.
God, by an eternal resolve of His Will, predestines certain men, on account of their foreseen sins, to eternal rejection.
The human will remains free under the influence of efficacious grace, which is not irresistible.
There is grace which is truly sufficient and yet remains inefficacious.
The causes of Justification. (Defined by the Council of Trent) :
The final cause is the honour of God and of Christ and the eternal life of men.
The efficient cause is the mercy of God.
The meritorious cause is Jesus Christ, who as mediator between God and men, has made atonement for us and merited the grace by which we are justified.
The instrumental cause of the first justification is the Sacrament of Baptism. Thus it defines that Faith is a necessary precondition for justification (of adults).
The formal cause is God's Justice, not by which He Himself is just, but which He makes us just, that is, Sanctifying Grace.
The sinner can and must prepare himself by the help of actual grace for the reception of the grace by which he is justified.
The justification of an adult is not possible without faith.
Besides faith, further acts of disposition must be present.
Sanctifying grace sanctifies the soul.
Sanctifying grace makes the just man a friend of God.
Sanctifying grace makes the just man a child of God and gives him a claim to the inheritance of heaven.
The three Divine or theological virtues of faith, hope and charity are infused with sanctifying grace.
Without special Divine Revelation no one can know with the certainty of faith, if he be in the state of grace.
The degree of justifying grace is not identical in all the just.
Grace can be increased by good works.
The grace by which we are justified may be lost, and is lost by every grievous sin.
By his good works, the justified man really acquires a claim to supernatural reward from God.
A just man merits for himself through each good work an increase of sanctifying grace, eternal life (if death finds him in the state of grace) and an increase in heavenly glory.

Christ founded the Catholic Church.
Christ is the Head of the Catholic Church.

The Church founded by Christ is unique and one.
The Church founded by Christ is holy.
The Church founded by Christ is catholic.

XII. Penance

The Church has received from Christ the power of remitting sins committed after Baptism.
By the Church's Absolution sins are truly and immediately remitted.
The Church's power to forgive sins extends to all sin without exception.
The exercise of the Church's power to forgive sins is a judicial act.
The forgiveness of sins which takes place in the Tribunal of Penance is a true and proper Sacrament, which is distinct from the Sacrament of Baptism.
Extra-sacramental justification is effected by perfect sorrow only when it is associated with the desire for the Sacrament (votum sacramenti).
Contrition springing from the motive of fear is a morally good and supernatural act.
The Sacramental confession of sins is ordained by God and is necessary for salvation.
By virtue of Divine ordinance, all grievous sins according to kind and number, as well as those circumstances which alter their nature, are subject to the obligation of confession.
The confession of venial sins is not necessary but is permitted and is useful.
All temporal punishments for sin are not always remitted by God with the guilt of sin and the eternal punishment.
The priest has the right and duty, according to the nature of the sins and the ability of the penitent, to impose salutary and appropriate works for satisfaction.
Extra-sacramental penitential works, such as the performance of voluntary penitential practices and the patient bearing of trials sent by God, possess satisfactory value.
The form of the Sacrament of Penance consists in the words of Absolution.
Absolution, in association with the acts of the penitent, effects the forgiveness of sins.
The principal effect of the Sacrament of Penance is the reconciliation of the sinner with God.
The Sacrament of Penance is necessary for salvation to those who, after Baptism, fall into grievous sin.
The sole possessors of the Church's Power of Absolution are the bishops and priests.
Absolution given by deacons, clerics or lower rank, and laymen is not Sacramental Absolution.
The Sacrament of Penance can be received by any baptised person who, after Baptism, has committed a grievous or a venial sin.
